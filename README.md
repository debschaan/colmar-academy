# Colmar Academy - Codecademy Challenge Project

## Project Description

You are tasked with designing and creating the landing page for a new school. For this project we will provide you with wireframes. A wireframe allows designers and developers to focus on the flow of a site without getting distracted with design decisions such as color and typography. These aspects of the design are important, but when they are introduced too early, they can detract from other important decisions.
